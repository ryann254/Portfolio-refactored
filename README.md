# Ryan's Portfolio

This is my portfolio, it includes almost everything that I've done as a developer with links to my other projects and also descriptions of what I've achieved and what I want to achieve. I created it while I was learning Reactjs. It's a continous project that I try to keep up to date.


## Main Features: 
- It's fully mobile responsive.
- It contains a lot of projects that I've done.
- It has description of me and what I do.
- A contact form that anyone can use to contact me.

## Cool feature
- If you sign up and login with Okta you can leave comments about the site - This feature is needs some bug fixing.
